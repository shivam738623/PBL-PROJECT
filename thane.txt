    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Thane is the northern most district of Konkan region of Maharashtra. It is second
most populated district and one of the few industrially developed districts of the State.
Thane district is situated between western ghat on eastern side and Arabian Sea coast
on western side. On the northern side, it is bounded by forest area of Gujarat and on the
southern side it is bounded by Bombay City. The district lies between north latitude
18°25” and 20°12” and east longitude 72°27” and 73° 29”. It falls under Survey of India
topo sheets 46D, 46H, 47A and 47E. The area, of Thane district is 9337 sq.km and
occupies 3.11% of the total area of Maharashtra State. It extends for about 140 km from
north to south and 101km from east to west. District head quarter is located at Thane
town which is taluka head quarters also. Thane, Kalyan, Ulhas nagar, Ambernath and
Bhiwandi are the industrially important talukas and are having urban culture. About 3/5th
of the population lives in urban areas. The economy of the district is dependent on
agriculture, especially in rural areas. Jawahar and Suryamal are the hill stations. Arnala
fort, Mahim, Varjeshwari are the places famous for the tourism.
Thane district is divided into three sub-divisions viz., Thane, Bhiwandi and
Dahanu, which are further, divided into 15 talukas and 1748 villages. In addition to
these, there are 23 uninhabited villages. Out of the total villages 1203 villages are tribal.
There are as many as 925 Village Panchayats. The total population of Thane district as
per 2001census is 81,28,833. Rural population is 22,28,873 (27.4%) and the rest is
urban. Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe population is 2,71,797 (3.3%) and 9,51,205
(11.7%) respectively. The male population is 43,77,806 and female population is
37,51,027.</p>

<h1>GEOMOROLOGRAPHY AND SOIL TYPES</h1>
<p>The district forms part of Western Ghat and Deccan Plateau. Physiographically
the district can be divided in to three distinct belts i.e. (1) The western belt stretching 
from 16 to 31 km east of Sahayadri- an extremely rugged country cut by deep valleys,
divided and crossed by hill ranges. (2) The central belt extending for about 30 km
east of western belt across the tract whose eastern belt is roughly marked by a line
drawn from Pabal in the north to south up to Purandhar through Pune. In this belt a
series of small hills stretch in to valleys and large spurs from Plateaux and (3) The
eastern belt with a rolling topography and low hills sinking slowly in to the plains with
relatively broader valleys. Therefore, the physiography of the district has given rise to
four major characteristic land forms namely; (1) The hills and Ghats (2) The foot hills
(3) the plateau and (4) the plains.</p>
 <p>The district has three major drainage systems namely (i) The BhimaGhod River System in northern, north-eastern and eastern part of which Bhima River
has a total length of about 355 km and Ghod river has a drainage of about 196 km.
(ii) Mula-Mutha River System covering the central part and having total length of 242
km in the district. (iii) Nira River system covering south, south-east and eastern part
and has total length of about 231 km in the district. The other Important rivers that are
flowing through the district are Bhima, Andhra, Karna, Shivganga, Pushpavati, Pauna
and Indrayani. All the rivers have most semi-dendritic drainage pattern and the
drainage density is quite high. Based on geomorphological setting and drainage
pattern the district is divided into 71 watersheds</p>


<h1>WATER LEVEL SCENARIO</h1>
<p>Central Ground Water Board monitors water levels in 43 Ground Water
Monitoring wells (GWMW) in the district. These GWMW are measured four times in a
year Viz. January (Rabi Season), May (Pre-monsoon), August (Monsoon) and
November (Post-Monsoon).</p>

<h1>DEPTH OF WATER LEVEL PRE MONSOON (May-2011)</h1>
<p>The premonsoon depth to water level monitored during May-2011 ranges
between 0.40 m.bgl (at Chinchwad) in west-central part and 20.10 mbgl (at Otur) in
northern part of the district. It is observed that in western half of the district where
more rainfall occurs, depth to water level during pre-monsoon season is less than 5
mbgl. Depth to water level in eastern and south-eastern part of district is reported
between 5 to 10 m bgl excepting in part of Daund, Baramati and Indapur talukas
where canal irrigation system is applied. In isolated pockets depth to water level is
occurring more than 10 mbgl in central parts (parts of Pune and Daund talukas) and
northern parts (parts of Junnar taluka).</p>

<h1>2 DEPTH OF WATER LEVEL POSTMONSOON</h1>
<p>The depth to water level in district during post-monsoon (Nov.2011) varies
from 0.65 at Dorlewadi to 15.65 m bgl at Otur. Shallow water level of less than 2 m
bgl is reported in almost entire western part, in central part (parts of Shirur and Khed
talukas) and in southeastern part (parts Daund and Baramati talukas) of the district.
In major part of the district in central, northern and southern parts the water level is
occurring between 2 to 5 m bgl. Deeper water levels of more than 10 m bgl are
restricted in extreme norhtern parts of the district (part of Junnar taluka). The post
monsoon depth to water level map is depicted</p>

<h1>GROUND WATER RESOURCES</h1>
<p>Central Ground Water Board and Ground Water Survey and Development
Agency (GSDA) of Maharashtra State have jointly carried out Taluka and Watershed
wise estimation of ground water resources of Pune district for base year 2008-09
according to GEC methodology 1997.Ground Water Resource Estimation figures as a
whole for Pune district indicates that Net Ground Water Availability is 1662.84 MCM
and Existing Ground Water Draft for all uses is 1189.08 MCM. After making provision
for Domestic and Industrial Supply for next 25 Years kept as 127.62 MCM, Ground
Water Availability for future Irrigation is 466.21 MCM. Over all Stage of Ground Water
development of the district is 71.51%. Two Talukas namely Baramati and
Purandhar are categorized as Semi-Critical where stage of ground water
development is computed as 96.13% and 83.95 % respectively. In these Talukas
further development of ground water is not recommended without adhering to the
precautionary measures i.e. artificial recharge to augment ground water resources
and adoption of ground water management practices in these areas. Taluka wise
ground water resources figures of Pune district are given below. </p>

<h1>GROUND WATER QUALITY</h1>
<p>CGWB is monitoring the ground water quality of the Pune district since the last
four decades through its established monitoring wells. The objectives behind the
monitoring are to develop an overall picture of the ground water quality of the district.
During the year 2011, the Board has carried out the ground water quality monitoring
of 24 monitoring wells. These wells mainly consist of the dug wells representing the
shallow aquifer. The sampling of ground water from these wells was carried out in the
month of May 2011 (pre-monsoon period). The water samples after collection were
immediately subjected to the analysis of various parameters in the Regional Chemical
Laboratory of the Board at Nagpur. The parameters analyzed, include pH, Electrical
Conductivity (EC), Total Alkalinity (TA), Total Hardness (TH), Nitrate (NO3) and
Fluoride (F). The sample collection, preservation, storage, transportation and analysis
were carried out as per the standard methods given in the manual of American Public
Health Association for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 1998). The
ground water quality data thus generated was first checked for completeness and
then the validation of data was carried out using standard checks. Subsequently, the
interpretation of data was carried out to develop the overall picture of ground water quality in the district in the year 2011.</p>

<h1>SUITABILITY OF GROUND WATER FOR DRINKING PURPOSES</h1>
<p>The suitability of ground water for drinking purpose is determined keeping in
view the effects of various chemical constituents in water on the biological system of
human being. Though many ions are very essential for the growth of human, but
when present in excess, have an adverse effect on human body. The standards
proposed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for drinking water (IS-10500-91,
Revised 2003) were used to decide the suitability of ground water. The classification
of ground water samples was carried out based on the desirable and maximum
permissible limits for the parameters viz., TH, NO3 and F prescribed in the standards</p>
<p>The perusal of Table-6 shows that the concentrations of most of the
parameters are within desirable limit of the BIS standards except NO3 which has
recorded concentration of more than maximum permissible limits in 17% of samples .
Overall, it can be concluded that the ground water quality in the wells monitored in the
district is not much affected except nitrate concentration in some wells. </p>

<h1>STATUS OF GROUND WATER DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<p>Ground water development depends on many factors viz. availability, crops
water requirement, socio-economic fabric and on yield potential of aquifer system
existing in the area. Ground water in the district is predominantly used for irrigation as
it is major ground water utilizing sector. The minor irrigation data of year 2010-11
indicates that the area irrigated by ground water sources in Pune district is 1,45,500
hectares whereas canal irrigation accounts for 1,22,400 hectares and net irrigated
area by all sources stand as 3,20,000 hectares. Thus it is analyzed that ground water
is major source of irrigation and it accounts for 46 % of net irrigated area. It is
reported that there were 91,669 dugwells/tubewells in the district for irrigation in year
2010-11. In addition to this ground water is also important source of rural water
supply.
</p>

<p>Ground water has special significance for agricultural development in state of
Maharashtra. The ground water development in some part of the state has reached to
critical stage resulting in decline of ground water levels. Thus there is need to adopt
an integrated approach of development of ground water resources dovetailed with
ground water augmentation to provide sustainability to ground water development.
Excepting along rivers, almost entire district is underlain by Deccan Trap
Basalt and major parts of the district adjoining the hilly areas as well as the entire
northern, south western and south eastern parts have low ground water development
potential. Such areas occur in almost entire Junnar, Ambegaon, Maval, Mulshi,
Velhe, Bhor and parts of Khed and Shirur talukas. The central part of the district is
occupied by the areas with medium to high ground water potential. Such areas are
observed in parts of Khed, Shirur, Haveli and Purandar talukas and almost entire
Baramati and Daund talukas. In the hard rock areas of the district the ground water
can be developed through dugwells, which are the most feasible structure for ground
water development. The borewells generally tap deeper fractures thus selection of
site for pinpointing of borewells need proper scientific investigation.</P> 
<P>The yield of dugwells in the district may be expected from 30 to 150 m3
/day depending on the
local hydrogeological conditions.
The nature and yield potential of the aquifers occurring in different areas is
given below in Table-8. A perusal of Table-8 shows that the 5 talukas i.e., Haveli,
Shirur, Daund, Baramati and Purandar have medium to high yield potential and the
suitable abstraction structures are dugwell, DCB and borewells. However in Baramati
and Purandar talukas, which have been categorised as “Semi-Critical”, future ground
water development is not recommended without adhering to the precautionary
measures, i.e., artificial recharge to augment the ground water resources and
adoption of ground water management practices, so that the sustainable
development is achieved</p>

<h1>GROUND WATER RELATED PROBLEMS</h1>
<p>Parts of Pune district falls under rain shadow zone of Maharashtra
State. From long term rainfall data, it is observed that eastern, southern, south
eastern, central and nort western part of district around Indapur, Baramati, Jujuri,
Daund, Talegaon, Dhamdhare, Alandi,Shirur and Bhor covering about 50 %
geographical area experiences drought conditions. Therefore these areas are
classified as Drought Prone Areas. Decadal pre-monsoon water level trend (2002-11)
shows fall in water levels up to 0.56 m/year in 30% of the GWMW of the district,
whereas in postmonsoon season fall is observed upto 0.27 m/year in 37% of GWMW.</p>
<p>The falling trend of water level is observed in central-southern parts of the district (in
parts of Pune, Purandhar and Bhor talukas) and in small western part of Mulshi taluka
and in parts of Daund and Shirur talukas in eastern parts of the district..
Ground Water Resource Estimation for Year 2008-09 also reveals that the
stage of ground water development has reached up to 96.13% and two talukas of the
district namely Baramati and Purandhar are categorized under “Semi-Critical”
categories. This is an indication for critical situation of ground water conditions in
district for which implementation of rain water harvesting and artificial recharge
structures are to be given in depleting water levels areas.</p>
<p> Quality of ground water is also affected by excessive nitrate content of more
than 45mg/liter in some pockets which makes water unsuitable for drinking in those
pockets. In 17% water samples collected from CGWB Ground Water Monitoring
Wells excessive nitrate content was recorded during year 2011. Continuous intake of
high nitrate content water causes infant “Methaemoglobinamea” popularly known as
Blue Baby Syndrome. Thus all wells used for water supply should be first analyzed
for nitrate content and if nitrate concentration found beyond permissible limit of
45mg/liter then it should not be used for drinking. Adequate sanitary protection
including leakage from sewerage system in populated area should be taken to control
nitrate pollution in ground water system.

<h1>RECOMMENDATION</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Almost entire Pune district is underlain by Deccan Trap Basalt, where dugwells
are most feasible ground water abstraction structures for ground water development.</li
<li> Borewells are another alternative structures but their construction requires special
technical and scientific attention. Borewells generally tap deeper fracture in hard area
for which selection of sites is suggested at favorable hydrogeological locations.</li>
<li> The Overall Stage of Ground Water Development in the district has reached about
71.51%. Therefore future development of ground water resources should be taken up
with proper care and planning.</li>
<li>In Semi-Critical Baramati and Purandhar Talukas there is limited scope for further
ground water development unless scheme for augmentation of ground water
resources by means of artificial recharge is not made. Therefore future ground water
development is not recommended without adhering to precautionary measures i.e.
artificial recharge to augment ground water resources and adoption of ground water
management practices in these areas.</li>
<li>Haveli, Shirur and Daund talukas have medium to high yield potential and
suitable abstraction structures recommended for ground water development in theses
areas are dugwells, DCB and borewells.</li>
<li>Quality of ground water is also affected by excessive nitrate content of more than
45mg/liter which makes water unsuitable for drinking. In 17% water samples collected
from CGWB Ground Water Monitoring Wells, excessive nitrate content was recorded
during year 2011. Hence all wells used for water supply should be first analyzed for
nitrate content and if nitrate concentration found beyond permissible limit of 45mg/liter
then it should not be used for drinking. Adequate sanitary protection including
leakage from sewerage system in populated area should be taken to control nitrate
pollution in ground water system.</li>
<li> There is scope for construction of suitable artificial recharge structures in the
district especially in Semi-Critical areas. The structures recommended for hilly areas
in west and north west parts are Contour Bunds, Gully Plugs, Nala Bunds and Check
Dams etc. In other part of district structures like Nala Bunds, Check dams. KT Weirs
and Percolation Tanks are suggested at suitable hydrogeological locations. Existing
Dug Wells may also be used for artificial recharge of ground water, but due care is to
be taken for pure and silt free water is used for recharge.</li>
<li> Existing Percolation Tanks and village Ponds needs to be rejuvenated to act as
water conservation and artificial recharge structures.</li>
<li> For creating awareness among people towards water conservation and
Augmentation of Ground Water Resources, Mass Awareness Programmes should be
organized in large scale involving local public. Similarly Farmers should also be
encouraged to adoption of appropriate crops planning and also to adopt modern
irrigation practices including drip and sprinkler irrigation system.</li>
